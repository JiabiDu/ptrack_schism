add resuspension: 
   1. reading bottom shear stress; 
   2. set particle not movable after reaching the bottom when bottom shear stress is less the crtical depositional shear stress; 
   3. add sediment age; 
   4. resuspened into the last layer when the bottom shear stress is larger than the critical erosional shear stress

add random walk, propotional to eddy diffusivity

add newIO




============================ LESSSONS =============================

2. when push to remote repo, need to "git fetch" to update the current repo
