add variable: status, dob, age, life (1000 at the beginning)
add option to settling after certain of age, add module for larvae
add mortality as a function of salinity and temperature for oyster larvae
add random warlk, propotional to eddy diffusivity
add new IO
add module microplastic, oyster, call the calculation if the module is on, within the ptrack3.f90, 
add resuspension: 
   1. reading bottom shear stress; 
   2. set particle not movable after reaching the bottom when bottom shear stress is less the crtical depositional shear stress; 
   3. add sediment age; 
   4. resuspened into the last layer when the bottom shear stress is larger than the critical erosional shear stress


============================ LESSSONS =============================
1. need to add 'return' in subroutine, otherwise error will show up

2. when push to remote repo, need to "git fetch" to update the current repo

3. make the parameters in the global module and avoid declare any of them in other subroutines.
